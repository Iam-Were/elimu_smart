### Technical Implementation Priorities

#### 1. Design System First
```css
/* Implement complete theme system */
:root {
  /* Student Theme (Orange) */
  --primary: #f97316;
  --secondary: #fef3c7;
  
  /* Counselor Theme (Yellow) */
  --counselor-primary: #eab308;
  --counselor-secondary: #fef3c7;
  
  /* Admin Theme (Purple) */
  --admin-primary: #a855f7;
  --admin-secondary: #f3e8ff;
}
```

#### 2. Component Architecture
```typescript
// Core component structure
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppLayout.tsx        // Main app container
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthLayout.tsx       // Authentication wrapper
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DashboardLayout.tsx  // Role-specific dashboards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student/             // Student-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ counselor/           // Counselor-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/               // Admin-specific components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common/                  // Shared components
```

#### 3. State Management
```typescript
// Authentication and theme management
interface AppState {
  auth: {
    user: User | null;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
    role: 'student' | 'counselor' | 'admin';
  };
  theme: {
    currentTheme: 'student' | 'counselor' | 'admin';
    mode: 'demo' | 'production';
  };
}
```

### Key Implementation Guidelines

#### Role-Based Theming
- Apply theme classes to `<body>` element
- Use CSS custom properties throughout
- Implement smooth transitions (300ms)
- Test theme switching between all roles

#### Mobile-First Design
- Start with mobile layouts
- Use responsive breakpoints consistently
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions (44px minimum)
- Test on actual mobile devices

#### Accessibility Standards
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

#### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## üîÑ Iterative Development Strategy

### MVP-First Approach
1. **Build core functionality first** (authentication, basic dashboards)
2. **Add enhanced features incrementally** (analytics, automation)
3. **Test thoroughly at each sprint** (unit, integration, E2E)
4. **Gather feedback and iterate** (user testing, stakeholder review)

### Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: 90%+ coverage, all tests passing
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals green, <3s load time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- **Design**: Consistent theme application, responsive design

### Risk Mitigation
- **Complex Features**: Break into smaller, testable components
- **Integration Issues**: Test early and often with mock data
- **Performance Problems**: Monitor metrics throughout development
- **Security Concerns**: Implement security measures from day one
