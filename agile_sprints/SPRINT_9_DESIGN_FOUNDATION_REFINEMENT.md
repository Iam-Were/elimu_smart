## üé® Design Analysis from Figma

### Color Application Issues to Fix
```css
/* Current Issues Identified */
.button-primary {
  /* WRONG: Using generic orange */
  background: #f97316;
  
  /* CORRECT: Match Figma exact shade */
  background: #ff6b35; /* Figma's exact orange */
}

/* Icon Color Issues */
.sidebar-icon {
  /* WRONG: Icons not theme-aware */
  color: #666;
  
  /* CORRECT: Role-based icon colors */
  color: var(--sidebar-foreground);
}
```

### Button Refinement Requirements
Based on Figma analysis:
- **Primary Buttons**: Exact orange (#ff6b35) with white text
- **Secondary Buttons**: Outline style with theme colors
- **Icon Buttons**: Consistent 20px icons with proper spacing
- **Button Heights**: 40px standard, 32px compact, 48px prominent

### Card Layout Specifications
```css
/* Figma Card Specifications */
.dashboard-card {
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  background: #ffffff;
  border: 1px solid #f0f0f0;
}

.card-header {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

.card-content {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Color Audit & Fix System
```typescript
interface ColorAudit {
  component: string;
  currentColor: string;
  figmaColor: string;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  roleSpecific: boolean;
}

const colorAuditResults: ColorAudit[] = [
  {
    component: 'Primary Button',
    currentColor: '#f97316',
    figmaColor: '#ff6b35',
    priority: 'high',
    roleSpecific: true
  },
  // ... more audit results
];
```

### Component Refinement Framework
```typescript
// Component-specific design tokens
interface ComponentTokens {
  spacing: {
    padding: string;
    margin: string;
    gap: string;
  };
  colors: {
    background: string;
    foreground: string;
    border: string;
  };
  typography: {
    fontSize: string;
    fontWeight: string;
    lineHeight: string;
  };
  effects: {
    borderRadius: string;
    boxShadow: string;
    transition: string;
  };
}
```

## üìä LinkedIn-Inspired Design Patterns

### Professional Card Design
```css
.linkedin-card {
  background: #ffffff;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 20px;
  transition: box-shadow 0.2s ease;
}

.linkedin-card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

### Professional Button Hierarchy
```css
.btn-primary-linkedin {
  background: var(--primary);
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 24px;
  padding: 8px 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 14px;
}

.btn-secondary-linkedin {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--primary);
  border: 1px solid var(--primary);
  border-radius: 24px;
  padding: 8px 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

### Navigation Enhancement
```css
.sidebar-item-linkedin {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
}

.sidebar-item-linkedin:hover {
  background-color: var(--sidebar-accent);
}

.sidebar-item-linkedin.active {
  background-color: var(--primary);
  color: var(--primary-foreground);
}
```
