# Sprint 1: Foundation & Setup (Weeks 1-2)

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Establish the core foundation of the Elimu Smart platform with project setup, design system implementation, and basic routing structure.

## 📋 User Stories

### Epic: Project Foundation
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up the core project structure  
**So that** I have a solid foundation for building the platform

#### Story 1.1: Project Initialization (8 points)
```
As a developer
I want to create a new React + TypeScript project with Vite
So that I have modern build tooling and development experience

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Create Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Set up folder structure matching original platform
- [x] Install core dependencies (Mantine UI, Tailwind CSS v4)
- [x] Configure TypeScript strict mode
```

#### Story 1.2: Design System Implementation (13 points)
```
As a user
I want the platform to have consistent, role-based theming
So that the interface adapts to my role (student/counselor/admin)

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Implement CSS custom properties for all three themes
- [x] Create role-based theme switching functionality
- [x] Configure Mantine theme with custom colors
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS v4 with theme integration
- [x] Implement smooth theme transitions (300ms)
- [x] Test theme switching between all three roles
```

#### Story 1.3: Core Layout Structure (5 points)
```
As a user
I want a responsive layout that works on all devices
So that I can access the platform from any device

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Create responsive App Layout component
- [x] Implement mobile-first design approach
- [x] Set up basic routing with React Router
- [x] Create ErrorBoundary for robust error handling
- [x] Implement LoadingOverlay for async operations
```

### Design System Implementation
- Implement complete CSS custom properties system
- Create `applyRoleTheme()` function for dynamic theme switching
- Configure Mantine theme with role-based color overrides
- Set up responsive breakpoints and spacing system

### Development Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Git workflow with conventional commits
- Component documentation with JSDoc

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Theme switching functionality
- Error boundary behavior  
- Layout component rendering
- Responsive design breakpoints

### Integration Tests
- Theme persistence across page loads
- Route navigation functionality
- Error handling flows

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px  
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px for interactive elements
- Thumb-friendly navigation on mobile
- Accessible focus indicators

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] All components use CSS custom properties (no hardcoded colors)
- [ ] Theme switching works smoothly between all three roles
- [ ] Layout is fully responsive on all target devices
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors or warnings
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier pass with zero issues
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and handle all error scenarios
- [ ] Performance: Initial load under 3 seconds
- [ ] Accessibility: Focus indicators and keyboard navigation work

## 🚀 Deliverables

1. **Complete project setup** with build pipeline
2. **Design system implementation** with role-based theming
3. **Core layout components** with responsive design
4. **Developer documentation** for setup and contribution
5. **Testing framework** setup and initial test coverage

## 📊 Sprint Metrics

- **Story Points**: 26 points
- **Estimated Velocity**: 26 points (baseline sprint)
- **Risk Level**: Low (foundation work)
- **Dependencies**: None

## 🔄 Sprint Review Criteria

### Demo Requirements
- Show theme switching between all three roles
- Demonstrate responsive design on different screen sizes
- Navigate through basic route structure
- Show error handling with ErrorBoundary

### Stakeholder Questions
1. Does the theme switching feel smooth and professional?
2. Is the responsive design working well on mobile devices?
3. Does the overall structure feel scalable for future features?
4. Are the loading states and error handling adequate?
