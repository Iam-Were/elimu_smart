â””â”€â”€ main.tsx                // Entry point
```

**Theme Implementation:**

- CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Role-based theme classes (.theme-admin, .theme-counselor)

- Dark mode support for all themes

**Component Patterns:**

- Use CSS custom properties (var(--primary)) instead of hardcoded colors
- Implement hover effects with translateY(-2px)
- Use consistent border radius (var(--radius))
- Apply proper spacing using the 8px grid system

**Responsive Design:**

- Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- Touch-friendly button sizing (44px minimum)
- Responsive navigation and layout
- Safe area handling for mobile devices
