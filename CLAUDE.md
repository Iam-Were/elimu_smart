   - Never mix uppercase/lowercase: avoid `@/components/ui/Button`

2. **Routing Consistency**
   - Navigation links must match actual routes in App.tsx
   - Missing routes cause 404s - add all navigation targets
   - Use unified pages for similar functionality to reduce complexity

3. **Component Migration Checklist**
   - [ ] Replace Mantine imports with shadcn imports
   - [ ] Update component props to shadcn API
   - [ ] Test all interactive elements
   - [ ] Verify responsive design works
   - [ ] Check all routing still functions

4. **Build Error Patterns**
   - Missing exports in index.ts after deleting files
   - Button variant mismatches ("primary" vs "default")
   - Case sensitivity conflicts on Windows
   - Unused imports (warnings, not failures)

### Current Status
- ✅ Student journey fully migrated to shadcn
- ✅ Routing structure cleaned and logical

### Key Learnings for Future Development

#### 1. Role-Based Architecture Patterns
```typescript
// GOOD: Centralized role logic
const getRoleBasedRoute = (role: UserRole) => {
  const routeMap = {
    counselor: '/counselor/dashboard',
    admin: '/admin/dashboard',
    student: '/dashboard'
  };
  return routeMap[role] || '/dashboard';
};

// AVOID: Scattered role checks throughout components
```

#### 2. Theme Application Best Practices
```typescript
// GOOD: Error handling with fallback
try {
  applyRoleTheme(roleTheme);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // Ensure applied
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Theme failed, using fallback');
  applyRoleTheme('student'); // Safe fallback
}

// AVOID: Theme application without error handling
```

#### 3. Accessibility Integration Patterns
```tsx
// GOOD: Screen reader announcements
<div className="sr-only" aria-live="polite" role="status">
  {user?.role && `Switched to ${user.role} mode`}
</div>

// GOOD: Contextual navigation labeling
<header aria-label={`Navigation for ${user?.role || 'user'} role`}>
```

#### 4. Performance Monitoring Integration
```typescript
// GOOD: Performance tracking for optimization
const start = performance.now();
navigate('/counselor/dashboard');
console.log(`Navigation: ${performance.now() - start}ms`);

// USEFUL: Helps identify performance bottlenecks
```

### Build & Quality Commands
```bash
# Always run after navigation changes:
cd frontend
npm run build    # Check compilation (warnings OK, errors not OK)
npm run lint     # Check code quality
npm run lint --fix  # Auto-fix linting issues

# Test role-based navigation:
# 1. Login as counselor@elimu.com / counselor
# 2. Verify lands on /counselor/dashboard
# 3. Check yellow theme applied
# 4. Test Home button shows "Counselor Hub"
```
